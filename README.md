# MIPS-Simulator

This simulator takes in 32 bit hexadecimal MIPS code and runs a simulated version of how MIPS normally operates, printing the contents of memory and the registers before and the simulation runs, as well as some statistics of how many of each kind of operation was executed. This program runs on a limited set of the original MIPS instruction set.

This is meant to be a demonstration of how code is decoded and executed and the assembly level.
